# JS Project Part 10 and 11- Presentation

- My project topic is building a speed typing game that tested peopleâ€™s WPM.

- It ended up being based around a function that made a car move faster or slower depending on whether
  the player gets faster or slower at accurately typing in the quote and hitting the period to submit it.

- I had a difficult time figuring out how to make all the pieces fit together for a while. I watched tutorials and talked to AI and tried things again.

- I did figure out what happens when your car gets to the right side of the screen while the timer is still going and the speed should be too(it disappears).

- I did not want to make it come out again starting on the right side again, though!

- I would like to figure out how to make the car be infinitely scrolling like the road but so it still seems to be always slowing down or speeding up (but without ever hitting the right hand side).

- I think the answer is probably to use parallax scrolling in a game where the background goes at a different speed. I would need to figure that out!
