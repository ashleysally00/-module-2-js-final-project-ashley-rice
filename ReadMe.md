Play the [Let's Go Driving game online here!](https://ashleysally00.github.io/lets-go-driving-speed-typing-game/)

Let's go driving is a speed typing game where you copy quotes into a box as quickly and accurately as you can to make the car move forward based on your speed.

The first part of this game, including the timer, the typing box, the red and green text, and the fetching the quote I got from coding along with a web dev simplified speed typing game.

I added a car and made the car move right based on the speed of the player typing in the quote correctly and designed a usable interface for it.

This is an MVP and not a built out-game. 

Here's a link to the wiki describing my MVP process:
