Let's go driving is a speed typing game where you copy quotes into a box as quickly and accurately as you can to make the car move forward based on your speed.

The first part of this game, including the timer, the typing box, the red and green text, and the fetching the quote I got from coding along with a Web Dev Simplified speed typing game.

I added the functionality for a car in JS and made the car move forward based on the speed of the player typing in the quote correctly. Then I created a usable visual interface for it.
